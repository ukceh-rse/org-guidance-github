# Justification for proposal

This document aims to convey the reasons why and how curation and re-organisation of the organisation GitHub instance should take place.

### Background (Problem)

A GitHub organisation is not just a collection of software repositories, but has multiple purposes such as:
- A place to collect all the software created by an organisation
- A way to showcase and share those research outputs
- A location for templates and resources for staff.

The [UKCEH Organisation on GitHub](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/) has grown organically as a way to share code. At the moment the UKCEH organisation exists only as a collection of software and ideas; there are a few templates, but these are hard to find. There is an opportunity to showcase research outputs, and present an attractive portfolio, which is being missed.

### What can we change? (Opportunity)

We now have a team of RSEs within UKCEH who are able to devote time and effort to support researchers in creating software and using version control. The RSE team is starting to create courses and as such are able to encourage best practices amongst researchers.

### What should we do? (Practical Steps)

We need to work with researchers to understand how they use GitHub and recommend some minimal guidance which should be followed when using GitHub and sharing code/software. 

### What is the result? (Promise)

By creating guidance on how to use GitHub it will be we will be able to showcase the software created at UKCEH.  Utilising categorisation through clearly labelled with topics users would be able to allow quick filtering of repositories by type. This makes it easier to share software and templates inside UKCEH reducing time spent reinventing things.
