## Proposed changes to UKCEH GitHub Organisation

### Landing page and showcase

An organisation on GitHub is a landing page for anything that organisation creates.  It can be plain with limitted information, but is a great opportunity to explain who we are, and showcase our proudest / most popular repositories. A good example of this can be seen on [GitHub's organisation](https://github.com/github)   

We should aim to create a short README which explains who we are and what to expect in the repository.  This could and should link to SA/Group/Sub-Team repositories, and potentially ones we are major partners on.

### Renaming the organisation

Whilst not neccessary it might be useful to take this chance to rename the organisation on GitHub,  It is currently **nerc-CEH**, for branding and consistency changing this to **UKCEH** may be better.  There are two ways to do this: One option is to rename the organisation.  All repository url will then change, but urls using the old name will be redirected, and users would receive warnings that the name has been changed if they try to use the old one. How long these redirects persist for is unclear. What happens if someone re-creates the nerc-CEH organisation is also unclear.  The other option is to create a new **UKCEH** organisation and migrate repositories across as they are brought up to the guidlines listed in the document. This would be more managagable and the urls will redirect as before.  UKCEH will then retain control of the nerc-CEH organisation so no-one else can claim it. This would also allow IT to better control and understand the membership of the current organisation.

We caution through that github usernames should not be specific to a Company/University/Organisation.  These much like ORCIDs and names provide researchers with a history of their outputs and contributions.

### Cleaning up the Organisation

There are may repositories in the GitHub organisation that provide little to no benefit to UKCEHs external profile, and perhaps lower it.  These should be made private or deleted.  This could be done in conjunction with the second renaming option. Examples of such repositories which need pruning or cleaning up are:
 - https://github.com/NERC-CEH/hello-world 
 - https://github.com/NERC-CEH/puppet-selendroid
